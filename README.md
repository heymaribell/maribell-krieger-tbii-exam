Technological Basics II


The Daily Task Generator application was developed to help users, especially those with ADHD, organize their daily tasks in a fun and engaging manner. Users can input up to ten tasks and a reward for completing all tasks, with a limit set to avoid overwhelming them. 
The app was inspired by the developer's friend who has ADHD and finds it difficult to organize and start tasks. The goal was to create a simple yet effective tool to help users prioritize tasks and motivate them through a reward system. Key features include a ten-second breathing period, task input, random task selection, and reward display.

The application was developed using Python and Tkinter for its simplicity and ease of use. Key components include the main window, loading bar, task input entries, and message boxes.
Design-wise, the app focuses on a calming and supportive environment using the color green and a simple, uncluttered layout. Green's soothing properties help reduce stress and enhance focus, especially beneficial for users with ADHD. A simple design minimizes distractions, reduces cognitive load, and promotes usability.
The core functionality involves randomly selecting tasks from a user-defined list, ensuring true randomness with Python's `random.shuffle` method. After all tasks are completed, a message box displays the user's reward, providing motivation and a sense of achievement.
Future enhancements include task persistence and a mobile version for wider accessibility. These improvements aim to make the app more versatile and user-friendly, expanding its reach and effectiveness.
