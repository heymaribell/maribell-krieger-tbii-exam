App Report 

Introduction
The Daily Task Generator application was developed with the intent to help users organize their daily tasks in a fun and engaging way. The application allows users to input up to ten tasks and a reward, if they want to, that they would receive upon completion of all tasks. The maximum of ten tasks at once, is to prevent users from feeling overwhelmed by long to-do lists. This report outlines the process of developing the application, detailing the key features, design decisions, and challenges encountered.
I need to preface this report by saying that I developed this app with a certain friend in mind. One of my good friends, Max, has been diagnosed with ADHD since his early childhood. For him, it sometimes is frustratingly difficult to get organised and start on tasks that he has been putting off for quite some time. Thus, I thought of an app that would cater to his needs, that would encompass many other peopleâ€™s needs, too.

Idea
The idea behind this app is to create a simple, yet effective tool that helps the user prioritise their tasks in a way that makes it easier for them to get started. For this, a simple, non-exciting design is of great importance. 
The initial concept for the Daily Task Generator was driven by the idea of gamifying daily task management., making it less predictable. The goal was to create an application that users could rely on to randomize their tasks and give the option to provide motivation through a reward system. The primary features include:
1. A ten second period of doing absolutely nothing but breathing.
2. The input of a maximum of ten tasks.
2. The random selection of tasks.
3. The input and display of a reward upon completion of tasks.


Development
The application was developed using Python, leveraging the Tkinter library for building the GUI. Tkinter, known for its simplicity and ease of use, makes it ideal for developing small to medium-sized desktop applications as Daily Task Generator. The key components developed included the main window, a loading bar, task input entries, and message boxes for user interaction.

Design
The Daily Task Generator app was designed with a clear focus on creating a calming and supportive environment for users, particularly those with ADHD. 
The simple, some might even call it boring, design of the application is made that way for a reason. Could I have included more vibrant colours and intricate design features? Yes, of course. But that would miss the point of the app, as it should be seen as a helpful tool instead of something flashy that distracts.
The main window was designed to be intuitive and visually appealing. It features simple labels, such as the application name and user directions, to guide the user, and a button to start the task generation process. Next, the user has the option to set a reward. An entry field was added to allow users to input a reward that would be displayed upon task completion. A progress bar was implemented to simulate a loading process, creating a sense of anticipation and engagement while also slowing things down and asking the user to focus on their breath for a period of ten seconds. A frame was created to hold ten entry widgets where users could input their tasks. These entries were arranged in a vertically stackable manner to ensure ease of access.
Two key design choices in achieving this goal were the use of the color green throughout the interface and maintaining a simple, uncluttered design.
The psychological impact of the colour green, was one of the key factors in the design-process. Green is a soothing colour, that also stands for hope, the calm amidst the chaos of the mind with its calming effect on the nervous system. It can lower anxiety levels and create a serene atmosphere, which is essential for users who may feel overwhelmed by their tasks and can be particularly beneficial in a task management application where the goal is to reduce stress and enhance focus. For individuals with ADHD, maintaining focus can be challenging. The calming properties of green can help create a more conducive environment for concentration and sustained attention.
A simple design minimizes unnecessary elements and distractions. This is crucial for individuals with ADHD, who may find it difficult to filter out extraneous information. By presenting only the essential components, the app helps users maintain focus on their tasks. A straightforward layout aids in quick comprehension and navigation. This reduces the cognitive load required to use the app, allowing users to concentrate on their tasks rather than struggling with complex interfaces. Consistent design elements and predictable interactions are particularly beneficial for users with ADHD. The simplicity of the design minimizes cognitive load, reduces distractions, and promotes usability.
The deliberate choice of green as the primary color and the emphasis on a simple, uncluttered design are fundamental to the effectiveness of the Daily Task Generator app, particularly for users with ADHD. Together, these design choices support users in managing their tasks more effectively, fostering a sense of achievement and well-being. The app stands as a testament to the power of thoughtful design in creating tools that not only function well but also provide a supportive and nurturing user experience.

Functionality
The core functionality of the app is to randomly pick a task from the user-defined list. This was implemented by shuffling the list of tasks before selecting a random task.
After all tasks are completed, a message box displays the reward entered by the user, providing a sense of achievement and motivation.
The need to shuffle tasks each time before picking a random task was a design decision to ensure true randomness and avoid picking the same task repeatedly. This was achieved using Python's `random.shuffle` method.
Providing a seamless user experience was paramount. The progress bar was implemented to enhance engagement, while the use of message boxes for task notifications and reward display kept the interface interactive.

Future Development Ideas
While the current version of the Daily Task Generator meets its primary objectives, there are some areas for potential enhancement:
1. Task Persistence: Allowing users to save and load tasks from previous sessions.
2. Mobile Version: Developing a mobile version of the app for wider accessibility.
